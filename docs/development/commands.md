# Commands

While developping on the project there is different type of commands that might be useful :

## Makefile commands

Makefile files have been created to **fasten development** there is 3 main ones :
- `./Makefile` : Contains all Docker actions
- `./symfony/Makefile` : Contains all commands related to Symfony (Symfony, Composer, Doctrine, ...)
- `./vue/Makefile` : Contains all commands related to the frontend (yarn, eslint)

All commands are accessible using `make` command from the root directory of the project as sub-Makefiles are included in the root one. 

::: info
If you work on the project it is **highly recommended that you check the available commands inside those files** to fasten your development.
